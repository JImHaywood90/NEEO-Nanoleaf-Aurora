Very basic Nanoleaf Aurora plugin for NEEO

Currently only the brightness slider and off/on buttons function!

Host IP and API Token will need to edited manually at the moment.

- Host IP Can be found dynamically by its mdns broadcast in terminal using the below command (requires avahi-utils);

avahi-browse _nanoleafapi._tcp --resolve -t |grep address| cut -d "=" -f2 | tr -d '[]'

Unfortunately, i've not workedout how to do this in nodejs yet

- Api Token needs to be generated by holding power button until the lights flash and then using "nanoleaves token" (from another Nanoleaf NPM module 'Nanoleaves')
